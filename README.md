# AugmentedReality-Abrasive-Wheel-Training
The project's aim was to reduce and hopefully eliminate a mundane and boring standard work procedure training during my internship as an safety intern. This was a self-initiated project and was my first time working with Augmented Reality. The user simply has to download the app and scan the pictures shown in the documentation and an 3 dimensional interactive training will commence.
